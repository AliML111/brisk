## :rocket: Feature: Downloading Video Streams From The Browser
- **Preqrequisite:** Brisk Browser Extension v.1.2.0

Brisk now support downloading m3u8 video streams from the browser. After a website has finished loading the video stream, click on the browser extension's icon to view all available m3u8 streams. From there, you can click "Download" and Brisk will capture the selected video stream.

**Note:** Since websites handle video streams differently from one another, if you encountered issues with downloading streams from a specific website, open an issue to let me know. It's important to note that downloading DRM encoded streams (SAMPLE-AES encryption) are not supported.

## :rocket: Feature: Proxy Settings

You can now set proxy settings in `Setting -> Connection -> Proxy`.

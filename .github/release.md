## :art: New UI
Almost all parts of the UI, except for the main page have been completely redesigned with better colors, layout structure, and overall UI clarity.

## :sparkles: Improved UX
Download checkboxes have been removed in favor of keyboard-controlled actions. You can now use common shortcuts like:
- `Ctrl + A` to select all downloads  
- `Delete` to remove selected downloads  
- `Shift + Left Click` to select a range  
- `Ctrl + Left Click` to select multiple downloads individually

## :rocket: Feature: Download Scheduling
You can now schedule to download a queue based on a **start time** and **end time**. You can also choose if you want the PC to be shut down automatically after the download is complete.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Bug Fixes and Improvements
- Fixed an issue where video streams couldnâ€™t be downloaded from several websites *(Requires browser extension v1.2.2)*  
- Fixed various bugs in the download engine for improved stability
- Upgraded to Flutter SDK v3.29.2

## :sparkles: Improved UX

- **New UI for multi download addition dialog:** The dialog that appears when brisk captures multiple download requests from the extension (when "download selected links with Brisk" is clicked) now has an improved UI. You'll be able to sort by file name and size and also delete the selected download items using the delete key on your keyboard.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Bug Fixes and Improvements

- Fixed "Failed to retrieve file information" for servers that reject HEAD requests
- Fixed browser integration bugs
- Released a new browser extension version (v1.2.3) with bug fixes for Chrome

## :pencil: Note
To prevent compatibility issues, Brisk will capture requests from an outdated version of the browser extension. If you're using an older version of the extension, there will be an error indicating that the extension version is outdated and you'll be prompted to Install the new one. For Firefox, the new version is already available in the official Firefox Addons webite.
